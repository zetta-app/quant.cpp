## TL;DR

quant.cpp's `turbo_kv_3b` / `turbo_kv_4b` types implement the same algorithmic structure as Google's TurboQuant (RHT → Lloyd-Max codebook → 1-bit QJL residual). However, on Llama 3.2 3B with WikiText-style perplexity, **`turbo_kv_*` is currently strictly worse than the simpler `uniform_4b`** at the same bit budget. We are not yet a faithful reproduction of the paper's reported quality.

This document records the actual measured numbers and tracks the gap.

## Measured Numbers

### Llama 3.2 3B Instruct (Q8_0 weights)

| KV type | Bits/elem | PPL | Δ vs FP32 | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **fp32** | 32 | 13.56 | baseline | reference |
| `uniform_4b` + FP16 V | 4 | **14.41** | **+6.3%** | simple per-block min-max ✅ recommended |
| `turbo_kv_4b` + FP16 V | 4 | 16.03 | +18.2% | RHT + 3-bit codebook + 1-bit QJL |
| `turbo_kv_3b` + FP16 V | 3 | 25.84 | +90.6% | RHT + 2-bit codebook + 1-bit QJL ❌ |

### SmolLM2 135M Instruct

| KV type | Bits/elem | PPL | Δ vs FP32 | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **fp32** | 32 | 18.62 | baseline | reference |
| `uniform_4b` + FP16 V | 4 | 20.33 | +9.2% | |
| `turbo_kv_4b` + FP16 V | 4 | 24.94 | +33.9% | |
| `turbo_kv_3b` + FP16 V | 3 | 68.23 | +266% | catastrophic |

## What the paper claims

| Model | Method | Paper number |
|---|---|---|
| Llama-3.1-8B | Full cache | LongBench 50.06 |
| Llama-3.1-8B | TurboQuant 3.5-bit | LongBench 50.06 (*identical to baseline*) |
| Llama-3.1-8B | TurboQuant 2.5-bit | LongBench 49.44 |
| — | NIH @ 3-bit | ~0.997 (vs 1.000 baseline) |

Translated to PPL terms, the paper's results imply approximately **zero PPL degradation at 3.5-bit** and **<2% degradation at 2.5-bit**. We are at **+18.2% at 4-bit** and **+90.6% at 3-bit** — orders of magnitude worse.

## Building blocks audit

| Component | Status | Notes |
|---|:--:|---|
| Per-vector L2 normalization (`‖x‖` stored as FP16) | ✅ correct | Lines 180–185 |
| Random Hadamard Transform (`tq_rht_transform`) | ✅ correct | Walsh-Hadamard + Rademacher |
| Lloyd-Max-Gaussian centroids | ✅ correct | Match Max 1960 N(0,1) tables to 4 decimals |
| `inv_std = √d` rescaling | ⚠️ suspect | Assumes coords are exactly N(0, 1/d). For finite d the marginal distribution of a uniform unit vector coordinate is `Beta(1/2, (d−1)/2)` rescaled, NOT exactly Gaussian. |
| Residual norm `‖r‖₂` stored as FP16 | ✅ correct | Lines 226–230 |
| 1-bit QJL sign hash on residual | ✅ correct | `compute_qjl_signs` |
| Pre-rotated query optimization | ✅ correct | `q_rot = RHT(query)` once |
| Inner product estimator combining stages | ⚠️ unverified | `dot1 + r_norm * qjl_correction` — formula may not exactly match paper |

## Hypotheses for the gap

1. **Lloyd-Max scaling**: After random rotation of a unit-norm vector, coordinates follow a `Beta(1/2, (d−1)/2)` distribution scaled to `[−1, 1]`, not exactly `N(0, 1/d)`. The discrepancy matters at small `d` (head_dim 64–128). Need to either (a) recompute centroids for the Beta distribution, or (b) verify that the Gaussian approximation suffices for `d ≥ 128`.

2. **QJL correction formula**: The paper's combined estimator is `⟨q, x̃_mse⟩ + ‖r‖₂ · ⟨q, Q_qjl⁻¹(Q_qjl(r))⟩`. Our code uses `dot1 + r_norm * qjl_dot * qjl_scale` where `qjl_scale = √(π/2) / sketch_dim`. The constant factor and the fact that residual is computed *after* normalization may both be off.

3. **Per-channel outlier handling**: The paper allocates extra bits to ~25% of channels identified as outliers. We do uniform per-channel allocation. This alone could account for a meaningful portion of the gap.

4. **Block size**: The paper operates on the full vector. We block at `TQ_BK = 128`. For `head_dim ≤ 128` this is moot, but the per-block normalization may interact differently with rotation than per-vector normalization.

5. **Sketch dimension**: We use `sketch_dim = head_dim`. The paper may use a different ratio (typically `sketch_dim ≥ 2·d` for QJL).

## What works today (recommended config)

For users who want maximum compression with minimum quality loss **today**, the recommended config is:

```bash
./build/quant model.gguf --chat -p "..." -k uniform_4b -v fp16   # 1.6x compression, +6.3% PPL on 3B
./build/quant model.gguf --chat -p "..." -k uniform_4b -v q4     # 6.9x compression, +6.3% PPL on 3B (V quality preserved)
```

`turbo_kv_*` is **not currently recommended** for production use until the gap is closed.

## Action items

1. ☐ Recompute Lloyd-Max centroids assuming `Beta(1/2, (d−1)/2)` for `d ∈ {64, 128, 256}`
2. ☐ Implement per-channel outlier extraction (32 outlier channels at higher bit width per the paper)
3. ☐ Verify QJL correction constant against the original QJL paper (arXiv:2406.03482)
4. ☐ Test with `sketch_dim = 2 · head_dim`
5. ☐ Ablation: turn off QJL stage entirely; measure MSE-only PPL to isolate stage 1 vs stage 2
6. ☐ Add a unit test that fails if `turbo_kv_4b` PPL on Llama 3.2 3B exceeds 14.5 (currently 16.03)
7. ☐ Track in GitHub issue for community visibility

## Reproducing this report

```bash
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
for k in fp32 uniform_4b turbo_kv_4b turbo_kv_3b; do
  echo "=== $k ==="
  ./build/quant models/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf \
    --ppl bench/data/ppl_1k.txt -j 8 -k $k -v fp16 2>&1 | tail -3
done
```

## Honest positioning

quant.cpp's existing **production-quality** KV compression is `uniform_4b`, which beats llama.cpp's q4_0 KV (+6.3% PPL vs +10.6% PPL on comparable benchmarks). It is **not** a Google TurboQuant reproduction. The `turbo_kv_*` types are an in-progress paper port that does not yet match published numbers.

We should not claim to be a "verified TurboQuant implementation" until at least one bit budget reproduces the paper's PPL within ±5%.
