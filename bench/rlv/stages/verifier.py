"""Stage 4: VERIFY (citation-grounded).

Day 1 lesson: verifying against the gist alone is too lossy. The gist
summaries are generic; the verifier can't tell if a hallucinated answer
is wrong because the gist also doesn't mention the entity.

Day 2 redesign: verify by **citation**. The verifier reads the actual
lookup region text (the same chunk Stage 3 read) and checks two things:

  1. Does the answer's key entity / fact appear *literally* in the
     region text? This is a fast non-LLM check using fuzzy substring
     matching that handles Q4 visual jitter.
  2. As a fallback when the literal check is ambiguous, ask the LLM:
     "Is this answer supported by the text below?" with a yes/no/unsure
     response.

The literal check is the fastest and most reliable hallucination filter
when the model is supposed to be quoting from a specific region. If the
answer mentions "John Williams" but the region text doesn't contain
"John" or "Williams" or "Williamlims" (jitter variants), the answer is
clearly fabricated.
