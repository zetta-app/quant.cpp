# quant.cpp: Practical KV Cache Compression in 67K Lines of C

## Abstract

We present quant.cpp, a minimal LLM inference engine that achieves 6.9x KV cache compression with zero perplexity degradation. The engine is implemented in 67K lines of C11 with no external dependencies, and ships as a 15K-line single-header library (quant.h) embeddable in any C project. We implement seven quantization algorithms for KV cache compression, including PolarQuant, QJL, and a novel delta compression scheme that enables 3-bit key quantization at only +1.3% PPL. On a 16GB Mac, quant.cpp extends context length from 50K to 350K tokens for Llama 3.2 3B, and from 4K to 30K tokens for Gemma 4 26B-A4B (128-expert MoE). We describe the architecture, quantization plugin system, and lessons learned from GPU acceleration experiments on Apple Silicon.

## 1. Introduction

Large language model inference is increasingly memory-bound. At 32K context length, an 8B model's KV cache consumes 4GB — more than the model weights themselves. While weight quantization (Q4, Q8) is well-studied, KV cache compression receives less attention despite dominating memory usage at long contexts.

Existing KV cache quantization in production engines (llama.cpp Q4_0) introduces +10.6% perplexity degradation — noticeable quality loss. We show that type-aware independent K/V quantization achieves +0.0% degradation at the same bit budget.

quant.cpp is designed around three principles:
1. **Readable**: The full transformer forward pass fits in one file (tq_transformer.c, 2500 lines).
2. **Embeddable**: The single-header quant.h (15K lines) compiles with `cc app.c -lm -lpthread`.
3. **Extensible**: Adding a new quantization type requires implementing three functions and registering them in a trait table.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Quantization Plugin System

Each KV quantization type is defined by a trait struct:

```c
typedef struct {
    const char* name;
    int block_size;          // elements per block (typically 128)
    size_t type_size;        // bytes per block
    void (*quantize)(const float* src, void* dst, int n);
    void (*dequantize)(const void* src, float* dst, int n);
    void (*attention)(const float* q, const void* kv, float* scores, int seq, int dim);
} tq_type_traits_t;
```

Seven types are implemented:

| Type | Bits | Algorithm | Block Size | PPL vs FP32 |
|------|------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| TQ_UNIFORM_4B | 4 | Min-max | 128 | +0.0% |
| TQ_UNIFORM_2B | 2 | Min-max | 128 | varies |
| TQ_POLAR_3B | 3 | PolarQuant | 128 | +0.8% |
| TQ_POLAR_4B | 4 | PolarQuant | 128 | +0.0% |
| TQ_QJL_1B | 1 | QJL sign hash | 256 | +3.2% |
| TQ_TURBO_3B | 3 | Polar 2b + QJL 1b | 128 | +1.0% |
| TQ_TURBO_4B | 4 | Polar 3b + QJL 1b | 128 | +0.0% |

### 2.2 Delta Compression

Standard KV caching stores each key vector independently. We observe that adjacent key vectors (positions t and t-1) differ by ~30% of their absolute range. Delta mode stores `key[t] - reconstruct(key[t-1])`, reducing the dynamic range and enabling 3-bit quantization.

Every 64 tokens, an FP32 I-frame is stored (like video compression) to bound drift accumulation. This yields 3-bit compression at +1.3% PPL, compared to +62% without delta encoding.

### 2.3 QK-Norm Aware Compression

Models with QK-norm (Gemma 4) normalize key vectors to the unit sphere, creating extremely sparse distributions (256 dimensions, ~56 active). We find that 4-bit quantization achieves only 0.62 cosine similarity on QK-normed keys — destroying directional information.

Our solution: auto-detect QK-normed models and store keys in FP32 while quantizing only values to Q4. This preserves perfect key precision with 3.5x value memory reduction.

## 3. Supported Architectures

quant.cpp supports seven model architectures:
- **Llama 3** (GQA, standard RoPE)
- **Qwen 3.5** (DeltaNet hybrid attention)
- **Gemma 3/4** (sliding + full attention, 4 norms/layer)
- **Gemma 4 MoE** (128 experts, dual-FFN, learned RoPE, GeGLU)
- **Qwen MoE** (256 experts, shared expert)

The Gemma 4 26B-A4B-it implementation required solving 10 architecture-specific issues including dual-FFN parallel execution, layer_output_scale semantics, and attention_scale=1.0 for QK-normed models.

## 4. GPU Acceleration Experiments

We conducted extensive Metal GPU experiments on Apple M1 Pro:

| Approach | SmolLM2 135M | vs CPU |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| CPU NEON Q4×Q8 fused dot | 96 tok/s | 1.0x |
| Per-matmul Metal dispatch | 38 tok/s | 0.4x |
| 2-commit GPU graph | 18 tok/s | 0.2x |
| 1-commit GPU graph | 22 tok/s | 0.2x |
| + Weight repacking | 27 tok/s | 0.3x |
| + uint16 mask kernel | 27 tok/s | 0.3x |

**Finding**: For batch-1 token generation on Apple Silicon unified memory, CPU NEON saturates memory bandwidth more efficiently than GPU due to command buffer dispatch overhead (~0.3ms per commit). GPU acceleration requires a tensor graph IR (like ggml) that compiles the entire forward pass into a single GPU dispatch — effectively building a GPU inference framework from scratch.

## 5. Performance

### 5.1 Speed

| Model | Params | tok/s (M1 Pro) |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| SmolLM2 135M | 135M | 96 |
| Llama 3.2 3B | 3B | 17 |
| Gemma 4 26B-A4B | 26B (4B active) | 3.9 |

### 5.2 KV Compression Quality

WikiText-2 PPL on SmolLM2 1.7B:

| Config | PPL | vs FP32 | Compression |
|--------|-----|---------|-------------|
| FP32 baseline | 14.63 | — | 1.0x |
| 4b K + FP16 V | 14.63 | +0.00% | 1.6x |
| 4b K + Q4 V | 14.57 | -0.4% | 6.9x |
| Delta 3b K + Q4 V | 14.82 | +1.3% | 8.5x |
| llama.cpp Q4_0 KV | 16.18 | +10.6% | 3.8x |

### 5.3 Context Extension

On 16GB Mac M1 Pro:

| Model | FP16 KV | quant.cpp KV | Gain |
|-------|---------|-------------|------|
| Llama 3.2 3B | 50K tokens | 350K tokens | 6.9x |
| Gemma 4 26B MoE | 4K tokens | 30K tokens | 6.9x |

## 7. Conclusion

quant.cpp demonstrates that practical KV cache compression is achievable in a minimal, embeddable codebase. The key insight is that independent K/V quantization with type-aware methods eliminates the quality degradation seen in uniform approaches. The project serves as both a production-ready library for embedding LLM inference in applications and a research platform for experimenting with new quantization algorithms.
