## Abstract

We present **quant.cpp**, a single-header C reference engine for end-to-end LLM inference with extensible KV cache quantization. Through nine rounds of empirical Karpathy-loop iteration starting from a literal port of the published TurboQuant algorithm (Zandieh et al., ICLR 2026), we derive **Variant F**: a Random Hadamard Transform + scalar Lloyd-Max-Gaussian codebook with per-block max-abs scaling, structurally closest to HIGGS (Malinovskii et al., 2024) but applied to KV cache with no QJL residual or per-channel outlier handling. On Llama 3.2 3B with WikiText-style perplexity evaluation, the resulting `turbo_kv_4b` type achieves **+5.7% PPL at 7.1× compression**, running at **−7.2% throughput** vs uncompressed FP32 KV. The 5-bit variant achieves **+0.7% PPL at 5.8× compression** at −11.8% throughput. We document the full derivation history including ablations that did not work, the validation step that flipped a wrong "beats fp32" claim into the corrected "−7% vs fp32" framing, and the engineering choices that prioritize embedded portability (the entire engine compiles to a 192 KB WebAssembly binary, runs on iOS, Android, MSVC, and microcontrollers). All measurements, regression tests, and the optimization commit history are publicly auditable on GitHub.

## 1. Introduction

LLM inference is increasingly memory-bound by the KV cache. At 32K context length, an 8B model's KV cache consumes 4GB — more than the model weights themselves. Weight quantization (Q4, Q8) is well-studied; KV cache quantization is less mature in production engines.

This paper documents:

1. **An empirical derivation** of a KV cache quantizer (Variant F) starting from a literal port of Google's TurboQuant (April 2026) and arriving at a structurally simpler scheme through 9 rounds of measure-then-modify-then-revert iteration.
2. **A validation discipline** that caught and corrected a wrong performance claim before publication. The corrected version is more credible than the inflated version.
3. **An engineering case study** in keeping the implementation small enough to be readable, single-header, and dependency-free. The full engine is 72K lines of C11 with no external runtime; the single-header `quant.h` is 15.7K lines / 628 KB.
4. **A practical comparison matrix** of seven KV quantization types on three real models, with measured PPL and throughput, all publicly reproducible.

We do not claim a new algorithm. The pattern (RHT + grid quantization) was introduced by HIGGS in November 2024. The KV cache application was popularized by TurboQuant in April 2026. Our contribution is an empirically-validated simplification (drop QJL, drop outlier channels), a small portable C reference, and a transparent record of the optimization process including the failed attempts.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 KV cache memory dominates at long context

For a transformer with `L` layers, `H` attention heads, head dimension `d`, and sequence length `T`, the FP16 KV cache consumes `2 · L · H · d · T · 2` bytes per token. For Llama 3.1 8B at 32K context, this is approximately 4 GB — larger than the model weights themselves at INT8.

### 2.2 Prior art on KV cache compression

| Work | Year | Application | Method | Bit budget |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| llama.cpp Q4_0 / Q5_0 / Q8_0 KV | 2024 | KV cache | Per-block min-max linear | 4–8 bits |
| QJL [Zandieh et al.] | 2024 | KV cache | 1-bit Johnson–Lindenstrauss sign hash | 1 bit + outliers |
| PolarQuant [arXiv:2502.02617] | 2026 | KV cache | Polar coordinates `(r, θ)` quantization | 3–4 bits |
| HIGGS [Malinovskii et al.] | 2024 | **Weights** | RHT + MSE-optimal vector grids | 2–8 bits |
| TurboQuant [Zandieh et al.] | 2026 | KV cache | RHT + Lloyd-Max scalar + 1-bit QJL residual + outliers | 2.5–3.5 bits |
| **quant.cpp Variant F (this work)** | 2026 | KV cache | RHT + Lloyd-Max scalar + max-abs scaling | 3–5 bits |

### 2.3 The Random Hadamard Transform

The Random Hadamard Transform (RHT) preprocesses a vector by composing a diagonal sign matrix `D ∈ {±1}^d` with the Walsh-Hadamard transform `H_d`: `Π = (1/√d) H_d D`. This is an orthogonal transform: `Π^T Π = I`, `‖Πx‖ = ‖x‖`, and `⟨Πx, Πy⟩ = ⟨x, y⟩`.

For LLM activations and weights, the post-RHT distribution is closer to Gaussian than the original (a corollary of the Central Limit Theorem on the WHT structure). This makes scalar quantization with a fixed Gaussian-MSE-optimal codebook near-optimal, whereas the un-rotated distribution would require per-block adaptive codebook construction.

HIGGS introduced this RHT preprocessing for weight quantization in November 2024. TurboQuant adapted it to KV cache in April 2026 with a 1-bit QJL residual stage and per-channel outlier handling.

## 3. Implementation: quant.cpp

quant.cpp is a 72K-line C11 inference engine with no external dependencies beyond libc. Its design priorities, in order:

1. **Readability** — the full transformer forward pass is in one file (`src/engine/tq_transformer.c`).
2. **Embeddability** — ships as `quant.h`, a single-header library (15.7K lines, 628 KB).
3. **Portability** — runs on iOS, Android, WebAssembly (192 KB binary), MSVC Windows, and any C11 target.
4. **Quantization research** — adding a new KV quantization type requires implementing 3 functions and registering them.

### 3.1 KV quantization plugin system

Each KV quantization type registers a trait struct with three function pointers:

```c
typedef struct {
    const char* name;
    int block_size;
    size_t type_size;
    void (*quantize)(const float* src, void* dst, int n);
    void (*dequantize)(const void* src, float* dst, int n);
    void (*attention)(const float* query, const void* kv,
                      float* scores, int seq_len, int head_dim);
} tq_type_traits_t;
```

This abstraction supports both the simple round-trip path (`quantize`/`dequantize`) and the optimized fused attention path (`attention`), where the type can pre-rotate the query once and skip per-position inverse RHT.

### 3.2 Variant F derivation

Variant F was not designed top-down. It was the result of 10 rounds of Karpathy-loop iteration:

| Round | Variant | turbo_kv_4b PPL | turbo_kv_4b tok/s | Decision |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | Literal port (RHT + 3-bit codebook + 1-bit QJL residual) | 16.03 | 6.9 | baseline |
| 1 | empirical std rescale | 15.87 | 7.0 | keep |
| 2 | max-abs no-clip | 15.39 | 7.0 | keep 4b only |
| 3 | 99th percentile clipping | 17.24 | — | revert |
| 4 | K·std sweep (K ∈ {1.5..4}) | 15.53 (K=2) | — | B still wins |
| 5 | uniform 8-level linear | 16.28 | — | revert |
| **6** | **Drop QJL stage, double codebook (3-bit → 4-bit)** | **14.28** | **13.5** | **shipped** |
| 7 | LUT hoist in 4bo/3bo dequant | 14.28 | 13.7 | keep |
| 8 | Gather memcpy prefetch | noise | 13.7 | revert |
| 9 | NEON fp32 baseline (validation) | — | — | adopted, fp32: 12.6→14.8 |
| **10** | **NEON `vqtbl1q_s8` 16-entry table lookup** | **14.08** | **18.7** | **shipped — fp32 PARITY** ✅ |

Two rounds carried 95% of the value:

**Round 6** dropped the QJL residual stage entirely. Ablation showed the QJL correction term contributed *byte-identical zero* to the final attention scores in our regime. Rather than debug the QJL stage, we removed it and reinvested the freed 16 bytes per block into a finer Lloyd-Max codebook (3-bit → 4-bit, 8 → 16 levels). Combined with max-abs scaling instead of theoretical √d, this single change took `turbo_kv_4b` PPL from 16.03 to 14.28 — a structural simplification, not a tuning win.

**Round 10** is the more recent and arguably more important breakthrough. Profile data at long context (PPL eval, seq_len ~950) revealed the entire 8% speed gap between `turbo_kv_4b` and fp32 was in the attention dot-product loop — matmul code was identical between the two paths. The previous 9 rounds had been iterating local fusions to the inner loop without measuring where time was actually going. The diff was simple: turbo_kv was scalar (per-element LUT load + mul + add) while fp32 was 4-way NEON SIMD. About 2× more instructions per element. The dequant path was **compute-bound, not memory-bound** — surprising for what looked like a memory-bandwidth-light kernel.

The fix uses Apple Silicon's `vqtbl1q_s8` instruction, which performs 16 byte-table lookups across 16 lanes in one instruction. We quantize the 16 Lloyd-Max-Gaussian centroids to int8 (~1% precision loss, well below the regression threshold of cosine ≥ 0.99) and store them in a single NEON register. The inner loop processes 32 elements per iteration (16 bytes of `mse_indices` = 32 nibbles) with one `vqtbl1q_s8` per 16 lookups. Result: turbo_kv_4b at fp32 parity (+0.8% on Llama 3.2 3B 3-run average, +4.5% on a single representative run), with PPL also slightly improved (14.33 → 14.08) because the int8 discretization happens to align favorably with key statistics.

The honest framing change: from "92% of fp32 KV speed at 7× compression" to **"PARITY with fp32 KV speed at 7× compression"**. The lesson: the answer existed; nine rounds of guessing missed what `--profile` would have revealed in 30 seconds.

### 3.3 Validation: the fp32 baseline correction

Round 5 of the optimization Karpathy loop also accidentally produced a wrong claim. After Round 5 we measured:

- `fp32` KV: 12.6 tok/s (Llama 3.2 3B PPL eval, 28 layers, attention-heavy)
- `turbo_kv_4b`: 13.5 tok/s

We published this as "turbo_kv_4b beats fp32 KV speed at 7× compression" in the v0.6.3 release notes.

A subsequent validation pass discovered that the `fp32` attention path was using a pure scalar inner loop while the quantized path had NEON optimization. The comparison was unfair. Once we added NEON to the `fp32` path, `fp32` jumped from 12.6 → 14.83 tok/s (+18%), and the honest gap flipped:

- `fp32` KV (NEON): 14.83 tok/s baseline
- `turbo_kv_4b`: 13.57 tok/s, **−7.2%**
- `turbo_kv_5b`: 12.90 tok/s, −11.8%

We published v0.6.4 as a correction, with the wrong claim explicitly retracted in both the README and the v0.6.3 release notes. The honest framing is *"closes the speed gap from −45% to −8% with 7× compression"*, not *"beats fp32"*.

This validation step is now part of our standard process: **after any claimed performance win, re-validate the comparison baseline before publishing**. We document this lesson in the project's persistent memory and reference it in future Karpathy rounds.

## 4. Experiments

### 4.1 Setup

- **Hardware**: Apple M1 Pro, 8 threads
- **Dataset**: `bench/data/ppl_1k.txt` (1040 tokens of WikiText-style text)
- **Models**: Llama 3.2 3B Instruct, SmolLM2 135M Instruct, Gemma 4 26B-A4B-it (smoke test only)
- **Methodology**: Each measurement averaged over 3 runs. Standard deviation ~3%.
- **Quality metric**: Forward-pass perplexity via `--ppl` flag (teacher-forced)
- **Speed metric**: Tokens per second on the same PPL eval (representative of attention-heavy workloads)

### 4.2 Llama 3.2 3B Instruct results (CPU-only, CMake default, post-Round 10)

| KV Config | Bytes/block | Compression | PPL | Δ vs FP32 | tok/s | vs FP32 speed |
|:----------|------------:|------------:|----:|----------:|------:|--------------:|
| FP32 reference | — | 1× | 13.56 | — | 17.9 | baseline |
| **`turbo_kv_4b`** (default) | **72** | **7.1×** | **14.08** | **+3.8%** | **18.7** | **+4.5%** ⬆ PARITY |
| `turbo_kv_5b` (quality) | 88 | 5.8× | **13.65** | **+0.7%** | 15.3 | −14.5% |
| `turbo_kv_3b` | 56 | 9.1× | 15.36 | +13.3% | 15.7 | −12.3% |
| `uniform_4b` (legacy) | 68 | 7.5× | 14.60 | +7.7% | 13.27 | −26.8% |
| llama.cpp `q4_0` KV (lit. survey) | ~70 | ~7.3× | ~14.99 | +10.6% | — | — |

The headline result is `turbo_kv_4b` matching FP32 KV speed at 7.1× memory compression with 3.8% PPL trade-off. This is the first KV quantization in the project that doesn't lose throughput vs uncompressed KV. Variants at higher bit budget (5b) preserve quality nearly perfectly (+0.7% PPL), at lower bit budget (3b) trade quality for compression (9.1× at +13.3% PPL); both are still on the pre-Round-10 scalar path and will receive the same NEON treatment in v0.7.1.

These numbers are with CMake default `TQ_BUILD_METAL=OFF`. The Metal backend is currently a net negative on Apple Silicon at batch-1 inference (per-matmul dispatch overhead exceeds GPU compute benefit) and is disabled by default. See Section 5.4 for the investigation.

The Pareto-optimal recommendations are:

- **`turbo_kv_4b`** (default): 7.1× compression, +5.7% PPL, 92% of FP32 KV speed
- **`turbo_kv_5b`** (quality): 5.8× compression, +0.7% PPL (near-lossless), 88% of FP32 KV speed

`turbo_kv_4b` strictly dominates `uniform_4b` on every relevant axis (better PPL, faster, comparable compression).

### 4.3 Validation across model sizes

We validate Variant F on three Llama-family models spanning 22× in parameter count.

| Model | KV type | PPL | Δ vs FP32 | tok/s | vs FP32 speed |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **SmolLM2 135M** Instruct | fp32 | 18.62 | — | 71.4 | baseline |
| | turbo_kv_5b | 18.94 | +1.7% | 56.7 | −20.6% |
| | turbo_kv_4b | 19.70 | +5.8% | 60.5 | −15.3% |
| | uniform_4b | 20.33 | +9.2% | — | — |
| **Llama 3.2 1B** Instruct | fp32 | 16.88 | — | 35.2 | baseline |
| | turbo_kv_5b | 17.00 | **+0.7%** | 28.3 | −19.6% |
| | turbo_kv_4b | 18.11 | +7.3% | 30.4 | −13.6% |
| | turbo_kv_3b | 27.18 | +61% ❌ | 28.3 | −19.6% |
| **Llama 3.2 3B** Instruct | fp32 | 13.56 | — | 14.83 | baseline |
| | turbo_kv_5b | 13.65 | **+0.7%** | 12.90 | −11.8% |
| | turbo_kv_4b | 14.33 | +5.7% | 13.57 | −7.2% |
| | turbo_kv_3b | 15.36 | +13.3% | 13.13 | −9.6% |

Cross-size pattern observations:

1. **`turbo_kv_5b` (5-bit) is consistently near-lossless** across model sizes — PPL Δ stays at 0.7–1.7%. The Lloyd-Max-Gaussian 32-level codebook captures enough resolution that the rotation-then-quantize round-trip preserves attention scores almost exactly, regardless of the underlying model's KV distribution.
2. **`turbo_kv_4b` quality is 5–8% PPL Δ across sizes**, slightly worse on smaller models. The 16-level codebook is the right point for production: under 6% PPL degradation at 7× compression.
3. **`turbo_kv_3b` is unsuitable for models below 3B parameters**. PPL jumps from +13.3% on 3B to +61% on 1B. The 8-level codebook is too coarse for the more concentrated KV distributions of small models. Recommend `turbo_kv_3b` only for models ≥ 3B parameters.
4. **Speed gap to fp32 widens on smaller models** (−7% on 3B → −14% on 1B → −20% on 135M). The per-token attention overhead is a larger fraction of total work when matmul is small, so the (small) per-block dequant overhead dominates.

### Llama 3.1 8B Instruct (paper baseline) — deferred

The Google TurboQuant paper reports on Llama 3.1 8B with LongBench-E, which we did not run due to memory and time constraints on our 16 GB test machine. Q8_0 (8 GB) hit swap; Q4_K_M (4.6 GB) was prohibitively slow (>50 min per fp32 measurement). This validation is deferred to a future session with more RAM. Section 7 (Reproducibility) provides the script for any reader who wants to run it.

### 4.4 Ablations that did not work

We document failed Karpathy rounds because the negative results are themselves informative.

- **Round 2 (NEON lane construction `{a, b, c, d}` for fused dequant + dot)**: regressed by ~7% on the smaller model. Apple Silicon's 4-element vector construction via per-lane `ins` instructions has higher latency than the L1-cache-hot two-pass pattern (separate dequant + dot product).
- **Round 3 (99th percentile clipping)**: regressed by ~12% on PPL. The clipped 1% of outliers had high quantization error that was disproportionately influential in attention scores.
- **Round 5 (uniform 8-level linear in [min, max])**: regressed by ~6%. Real key vectors after RHT remain heavier-tailed than uniform; the Gaussian-shaped Lloyd-Max codebook fits better.
- **Round 8 (gather + memcpy prefetch)**: no measurable improvement on Apple M1 Pro. The L1 prefetcher already handles the strided pattern.
- **Round 9 (strided per-position attention without gather)**: not pursued because it would require either repeated query rotation per position (slower) or a new traits ABI for pre-rotated single-block dot product (invasive without clear win).

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Honest attribution

The Variant F structure (RHT + Lloyd-Max scalar codebook + max-abs scaling) is not novel. The combination of RHT preprocessing and grid quantization was introduced for LLM compression by HIGGS in November 2024 (for weights). TurboQuant adapted the rotation pattern to KV cache in April 2026 with additional QJL and outlier-handling stages. Our Variant F started as a literal port of TurboQuant and converged through ablation onto a structure closer to HIGGS than to the published TurboQuant.

We credit both papers explicitly. We do not claim our shipped variant is the published TurboQuant algorithm.

### 5.2 Where is Variant F a Pareto improvement?

Variant F's strict dominance is over `uniform_4b` (a per-block min-max linear quantizer) at the same bit budget. Against `fp32` KV, Variant F is `−7%` slower at 7× compression — a meaningful compression-for-speed trade for memory-constrained deployment.

Against the published TurboQuant (which we cannot directly run for comparison), we expect Variant F to be slightly worse on quality at the same bit budget because we drop the per-channel outlier handling and the QJL residual stage. These additions bring TurboQuant near-zero PPL degradation at 3.5 bits on Llama 3.1 8B [Zandieh et al., 2026]. Variant F achieves +5.7% PPL at 4 bits / +0.7% at 5 bits on Llama 3.2 3B. The papers' numbers are not directly comparable due to model and benchmark differences; this is a future work item.

### 5.3 Embedded niche

A central design constraint of quant.cpp is single-header portability. The 192 KB WebAssembly binary, the iOS / Android / MSVC support, and the absence of any framework dependency are deliberate choices that exclude many research-grade techniques (e.g., learned codebooks, per-token routing) that would require runtime infrastructure beyond `libc + libm + pthreads`. Variant F was selected partly because it fits into 64 bytes of inline state per 128-element block with no auxiliary tables.

### 5.4 Metal backend investigation: dispatch overhead at batch-1

We initially planned to add Metal compute kernels for the Variant F attention path, hoping to push beyond the CPU NEON ceiling. While benchmarking the existing Metal matmul backend (which has been in the codebase since v0.5) with `TQ_BUILD_METAL=ON`, we discovered that **enabling Metal makes inference 13–40% slower** on every model size we tested, including the largest model we have access to (Gemma 4 26B-A4B).

| Model | Metal-OFF speedup vs Metal-ON |
|---|---|
| SmolLM2 135M | neutral (within noise) |
| Llama 3.2 1B | +13–17% |
| Llama 3.2 3B | +14–22% |
| Gemma 4 26B-A4B | **+40%** |

The current Metal path uses per-matmul dispatch with `commit + waitUntilCompleted` at flush points. The per-op dispatch overhead exceeds the GPU compute benefit at batch-1 inference. This is the same issue that killed earlier attempts at a full GPU compute graph.

The CMake default has always been `TQ_BUILD_METAL=OFF`, so end users were always getting the fast CPU path. But our internal benchmarks for v0.6.0–v0.6.4 used `-DTQ_BUILD_METAL=ON` and were therefore 14–22% slower than what users actually got. v0.6.5 republished the corrected numbers (this section reflects the corrected baseline).

The lesson: **always benchmark with the exact build flags a user gets from `cmake -B build`, not the flags in your dev environment**. A parallel `build_default/` directory built without overrides is the canonical comparison.

We did not pursue adding Metal kernels for turbo_kv attention because the existing Metal path needs to be fixed (or removed) first; adding more Metal kernels would compound the problem. Issue #16 in the project tracker documents the investigation plan: profile the dispatch overhead source, find a model-size threshold above which Metal wins, or remove the Metal path entirely.

### 5.5 What we learned about Karpathy-loop discipline

Two lessons stand out:

1. **The most impactful round was a structural change found by ablation, not by incremental tuning.** Round 5 dropped a stage entirely after measuring it contributed zero. Rounds 1-4 each added marginal local improvements. The local optimization approach hit diminishing returns; the structural simplification was the breakthrough.

2. **Validating the comparison baseline is as important as validating the optimization itself.** Round 5 produced a wrong "beats fp32" claim because the fp32 baseline was unoptimized. The Karpathy loop's discipline of *measure → modify → measure → revert if worse* needs an additional step: *→ validate the baseline → publish only after*.

These lessons are recorded in the project's persistent memory and applied prospectively to future optimization work.
