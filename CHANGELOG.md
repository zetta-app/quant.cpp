### Research — Working Memory Cliff tech report (Phase 1B)

We measured 204 NIAH trials across Llama-3.2-1B-Q8 and Llama-3.2-3B-Q4 to find where the "long-context replaces RAG" framing actually holds at edge-device scale. Both models exhibit a sharp cliff at less than 1% of their nominal 128K context window:

- **Llama-3.2-1B-Q8**: 100% retrieval at ctx=512, 44% at ctx=1024, 0% by ctx=1536 (graded cliff)
- **Llama-3.2-3B-Q4**: 100% at ctx=1024, 0% at ctx=1280 (**step function cliff**, no degradation interval)

A 6-trial FP32-weights control (`TQ_NO_Q4=1`) confirms the cliff sits in the **same place** when on-the-fly weight requantization is disabled — the cliff is a model property, not a quantization artifact. 6.4× KV compression is bit-for-bit identical to FP32 baseline in 18 of 20 cells. The cliff is also independent of the KV cache.

Above the cliff, the dominant failure mode is **synthesised hallucination** — the model fuses the planted needle into the haystack subject's biography (e.g., "In 2023 Boulter was hired as the chief financial officer..." where Boulter is the wikitext subject and Sarah Chen is the needle). This is the same silent-hallucination failure that vector RAG produces on retrieval miss, occurring in the regime that was supposed to *eliminate* it.

The honest reframing of v0.12's Beyond RAG result: it works for documents that fit in the model's *effective* working memory, which is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the nominal context window for the configurations we measured.

### Fixed

- **`-s <seed>` CLI flag**: documented in `--help` since the project's first release but never actually wired up. Passing `-s 42` previously fell through to the positional-arg branch and was parsed as a model path (`Loading model from 42... cannot open '42'`). Discovered while attempting a sampled NIAH seed sweep for the Working Memory Cliff tech report; fixed in `a8f6d8a`. Backwards compatible: callers that don't pass `-s` get bit-identical behaviour.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-04-11 — Beyond RAG

> **Chunking RAG was a workaround for small context windows.**
> **The workaround became dogma.**
> **Now context windows are big enough that we don't need the workaround.**
>
> See: [docs/beyond-rag-manifesto.md](docs/beyond-rag-manifesto.md)

### Headline: 7/7 vs 0/7

**Direct comparison on Llama 3.2 3B Q8_0:**

| Method | Accuracy | Behavior on failure |
|---|---:|---|
| Chunk-RAG (wrong section) | **0/7** | Hallucinates plausible lies |
| Full Document FP32 KV | **7/7** | Correct |
| **Full Document 6.4x compressed KV** | **7/7** | **Correct — zero quality loss** |

When chunk-RAG retrieved the wrong section, the model fabricated answers like "John Smith" for CTO (truth: Maria Santos) and "$1,000,000" for revenue (truth: 847M). Loading the full document via 6.4x KV compression produced 100% accuracy including multi-hop reasoning across sections.

**Why this matters:** RAG's fundamental assumption is "retrieval is reliable." When it fails, models silently hallucinate. KV compression eliminates this failure mode by making it practical to load full documents into context on consumer hardware.

Full benchmark: [bench/results/document_level_rag_breakthrough.md](bench/results/document_level_rag_breakthrough.md)

### Major: K/V Asymmetric Compression — 6.4x at +3% PPL

KIVI-style asymmetric quantization: K=4bit + V=Q4 + k128 progressive window.
- **2.9x → 6.4x compression** (+121%)
- PPL cost: +1.3% → +3.0% (+1.7pp)
- Verified at both 2082 and 4095 tokens
- 128K context Llama 3B fits in 9.5 GB (vs ~30 GB FP32)

### Major: H2O Token Eviction + PyramidKV

- H2O eviction: heavy-hitter detection with sink + recent window preservation
- PyramidKV: per-layer KV budget allocation based on attention entropy
- **Attention cost: 4.1ms → 1.7ms/tok at budget=128 (-59%)**
- Llama 1B layer entropy measured: Layer 1 = 6.29 bits, Layer 11 = 1.84 bits
- Output quality preserved (identical text vs no eviction)

### Major: --save-kv / --load-kv CLI

"Read Once, Query Forever" pattern:
```bash
./quant model.gguf -p "long doc..." --save-kv doc.kv  # process once
./quant model.gguf -p "question?"  --load-kv doc.kv  # query instantly
```

Per-layer strided save/load. Verified: 3B model recalls "PHOENIX" from saved context.

### Refactoring (R1, R3)

- DISPATCH_MATMUL macros: 4 dispatch chains consolidated
- Magic numbers replaced with TQ_MAX_HEAD_DIM / TQ_MAX_KV_DIM constants
- Zero warnings, 35/35 tests pass

### Bug Fixes

- Qwen3.5 text collapse at ~530 tokens — root cause: T=0 greedy entering repetition loop, KV quant error compounds. Added n-gram loop detection (4-gram × 3 repeats → stop).
- Qwen3.5 head_dim=256 multi-block dequant for KV cache
- Gemma 4 false attn_output_gate detection on ISWA hybrid attention

### Documentation

- New gh-pages educational guide site (Korean + English with toggle)
- "Beyond RAG: Document-Level Context" section in README + guide
- Document-Level RAG benchmark report
- Open Graph social preview image

### Honest Limitations

- Q4 weight artifacts in fact extraction: "Santos" → "SanSannt", semantically correct but visually noisy
- 1B model instruction-following limited; 3B+ recommended for QA
- 7B+ models constrained by 16GB Mac memory (model + KV pressure)
- Q4_K_M GGUF on-the-fly dequant has bug with TQ_NO_Q4 (workaround: default auto Q4 path works)

## [0.10.1] — 2026-04-10

### Progressive KV compression — FP32 quality at 3x compression

Measured on Llama 3.2 3B, 3970 tokens (BPE O(n log n) enabled):

| Config | PPL | vs FP32 | FP32 ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| FP32 | 19.41 | — | 100% |
| 4-bit + k128 (progressive) | **19.39** | **-0.1%** | **3.2%** |
| 4-bit flat | 20.02 | +3.1% | 0% |

128 FP32 tokens recover full quality regardless of context length. This is context-length-invariant: the same 128-token window works at 4K, 32K, or 128K context.

### BPE tokenizer: O(n²) → O(n log n)

Replaced the naive BPE merge loop (O(n²) per merge step) with a max-heap priority queue with lazy deletion. Enables tokenization of 17K+ character texts in seconds instead of minutes. Unlocked 3970-token PPL evaluation for honest long-context validation.

### Honest correction track (10 of 10 self-found)

- **#9**: 957-token eval caveat for S1 findings (53% FP32 at k512)
- **#10**: 2-bit + k512 Pareto claim withdrawn (PPL +36.7% at 3970 tokens)

### Features

- `progressive=True` in Python API (128-token FP32 window)
- `aggressive=True` (512-token FP32 window)
- `context_length=` parameter for longer context
- `save_context()` / `load_context()` — KV cache persistence
- Infinite scrollback (automatic context shift)
- WASM demo: IndexedDB caching + one-click "Try Demo"
- Model registry: SmolLM2-135M + Llama-3.2-1B

## [0.8.2] — 2026-04-09 (quant_free_string + leak fix)

### Eliminated the v0.8.1 leak in `Model.ask()`

v0.8.1 worked but leaked ~65 KB per `ask()` call, because the Python wrapper couldn't safely call `libc.free()` on a pointer allocated inside `libquant.dylib`'s malloc heap (cross-zone abort on macOS arm64).

v0.8.2 adds a tiny new export to the public C API:

```c
// quant.h
void quant_free_string(char* str);
```

The implementation lives in the same translation unit as `quant_ask`, so its `free()` call uses the dylib's malloc zone — same heap, no abort. The Python wrapper now calls `lib.quant_free_string(ptr)` instead of skipping the free.

Backwards compat: the binding uses `hasattr(lib, 'quant_free_string')` so older single-headers loaded via `QUANTCPP_LIB=...` continue to work (with the old leak behavior). New installs from PyPI 0.8.2 ship the updated `quant.h`.

Verified: `Model("model.gguf").ask("hi")` × 3 in a row, clean exit, no abort, no leak warning under faulthandler.

### Honest correction track is now 7 (still all self-found)

This is the 7th correction logged in v0.6.x → v0.8.x. Found by running `Model.ask` repeatedly in the v0.8.1 verification cycle. Goal: stay 100% self-found before any external user reports a regression.

### Still pending in v0.8.x

- **`kv_compress=1` / `=2` re-enable in Python bindings** — still requires `quant.h` regeneration against the v0.8.0+ multi-file source (the bundled header is an Apr-6 snapshot whose UNIFORM_4B path aborts on Llama). Tracked in [Issue #18](https://github.com/quantumaikr/quant.cpp/issues/18). Will land when we regenerate the single header.

---

## [0.8.1] — 2026-04-09 (Python bindings hotfix)

### `pip install quantcpp` is now actually usable

Two critical bugs were found in the v0.8.0 Python bindings within hours of publishing — by running an end-user simulation (`pip install` in a clean venv → `Model("file.gguf").ask("question")`). Both bugs were live for v0.8.0; v0.8.1 fixes them.

#### Bug 1: `Model("file.gguf").ask(...)` aborted on macOS arm64

Root cause: the Python wrapper defaulted to `kv_compress=1`, which routed through the bundled `quant.h`'s UNIFORM_4B KV path. The single-header is an Apr-6 snapshot that pre-dates the v0.8.0 multi-file source by several days, and that older KV path aborts on Llama-architecture models.

Fix: default `kv_compress=0` (no KV compression) in v0.8.1. Non-zero values warn and fall back. The CLI `quant` binary, which uses the multi-file engine, continues to work with all KV types.

A real fix waits on a fresh `quant.h` regen against the v0.8.0+ tree (tracked as v0.8.2).

#### Bug 2: `quant_ask` return string crashed `libc.free(ptr)`

Root cause: `quant_ask` allocates the response string inside `libquant.dylib`'s malloc heap. The Python wrapper called `ctypes.CDLL(None).free(ptr)` to release it — but on macOS arm64, that handle resolves to a different malloc zone than the dylib's. Cross-zone free → abort.

Fix: skip the explicit free in v0.8.1. We accept a ~65 KB leak per `ask()` call as a temporary tradeoff; `quant_free_ctx` / `quant_free_model` release the bulk of the memory at end of session. Tracked: add `quant_free_string(void*)` wrapper to `quant.h` in v0.8.2.

### Honest correction track record

This is corrections #5 and #6 in the project history (after the four in v0.6.x → v0.7.x). Both were caught by the project's own end-user-simulation testing, before any external user reported them. The pattern stands: **publish, simulate the user, fix in hours.**

### v0.8.0 status

PyPI 0.8.0 should be yanked (we strongly recommend upgrading to 0.8.1). Yanking only hides it from new `pip install` — anyone with a pinned `==0.8.0` install can still use it.

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-09

### Cross-platform SIMD: AVX2 port of turbo_kv attention

Round 10/11's NEON `vqtbl1q_s8` / `vqtbl2q_s8` table-lookup pattern is now mirrored on x86 AVX2 for all four turbo_kv attention variants. The breakthrough that achieved fp32 parity on Apple Silicon now extends to Linux/Windows x86-64 builds.

| Variant | NEON instruction | AVX2 instruction(s) | Layout |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4b | `vqtbl1q_s8` | `_mm_shuffle_epi8` | 16-entry codebook fits in 1 register |
| 5b | `vqtbl2q_s8` | 2× `_mm_shuffle_epi8` + `_mm_blendv_epi8` | 32-entry codebook split low/high |
| 5b_fast | `vqtbl2q_s8` | same as 5b, no bit-unpack | direct 1-byte index loads |
| 3b | `vqtbl1q_s8` (lower 8) | `_mm_shuffle_epi8` | 8-entry fits trivially |

The 32-entry codebook (5b/5b_fast) needs the BLENDV bit-trick on AVX2 since `PSHUFB` is per-lane 16-entry only. Performance is unmeasured on x86 in this release (CI builds & runs the new tests; benchmarking deferred to v0.8.x).

Tests added:
- `TurboKVRegression.KV_5B_FAST_AttentionCosine` — was missing coverage; now exercises 5b_fast on synthetic Gaussian keys (cosine > 0.999).

### Investigation: Issue #16 Metal dispatch overhead

Added `tq_metal_diag_get/reset()` flush counter so the PPL tool prints `flushes/token` and `ops/flush` at end of run. Reproducing the issue's exact command on Llama 3.2 3B Q8_0 turbo_kv_4b shows **0 flushes/token** — Metal batch path is never entered for Q8_0 weights because the gate `layer_has_gguf` requires `gguf_w*` (Q4_K on-the-fly path). Metal=ON and Metal=OFF are now identical in throughput on this model.

The remaining suspected slowdown sources (Q4_K + `tq_metal_forward_layer` Q4 path) are documented as next steps in the issue. The diag counter unblocks anyone with the right model from getting empirical numbers in one command.

### llama.cpp PR validation: KL divergence tool

`tools/quant.c` gains `--save-logits` and `--kl-baseline` for two-pass KL measurement against an fp32 baseline:

```bash
quant model.gguf --ppl text.txt -k fp32        --save-logits base.bin
quant model.gguf --ppl text.txt -k turbo_kv_4b --kl-baseline base.bin
# → "KL divergence (baseline || quantized): mean = 0.157466 over 1040 tokens"
```

This is the standard llama-perplexity-style validation needed by the upcoming llama.cpp PR (`docs/pr/2026-04-09-llama-cpp-pr-draft.md`).

### Explored and reverted

- **vdotq query quantization** (v0.9.0 candidate): replacing the int8→fp32→fma chain with `vdotq_s32(int8_codebook, int8_query)` gave +6% speed but **+1.5% PPL regression** on turbo_kv_4b. The cosine test (>0.99) was not sensitive enough to catch it; PPL gating caught it. Reverted; documented in memory `feedback_vdotq_query_quant_tradeoff`.

### Deferred

- **WASM SIMD port**: requires un-stubbing turbo_kv attention in `quant.h` (single-header) first. Tracked for v0.8.1.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-04-08

### Round 11 — NEON tbl pattern applied to 3b/5b (partial parity)

After Round 10 (turbo_kv_4b at fp32 parity via `vqtbl1q_s8`), Round 11 applied the same SIMD codebook lookup pattern to the remaining production variants. The lookup side scales beautifully (1 instruction per 16 lanes for any small codebook), but the **bit-unpack side** is the new bottleneck for non-byte-aligned packing.

Llama 3.2 3B PPL eval, 3 runs each (CPU-only, no Metal):

| Type | Round 10 → Round 11 | Δ | vs FP32 (R11) | PPL Δ |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| FP32 | 17.87 → 18.43 t/s | +3% | baseline | — |
| `turbo_kv_3b` | 16.10 → 16.57 t/s | +3% | **−10.1%** | +13.3% |
| **`turbo_kv_4b`** ⭐ | 18.17 → 18.17 t/s | parity (R10 stable) | **−1.4%** ✅ | +3.8% |
| `turbo_kv_5b` 🏆 | 15.43 → 16.80 t/s | **+9%** | **−8.8%** | +0.7% |

### Why 4b reached parity but 3b/5b didn't

| Type | Bit packing | Unpack | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4b | byte-aligned (2 nibbles/byte) | pure SIMD `vandq_u8` + `vshrq_n_u8` | **parity** ✅ |
| 3b | bit-aligned (irregular 3-bit fields) | uint64 read + scalar shifts | −10.1% |
| 5b | bit-aligned (irregular 5-bit fields) | uint64 read + scalar shifts | −8.8% |

For 3-bit and 5-bit, 16 indices straddle byte boundaries irregularly. We use the fastest scalar unpack we found (uint64 read + 16 scalar shifts + `vld1q_u8`) but it costs ~16 instructions per 16-element iteration. The lookup itself is 1 instruction. So the unpack now dominates for 3b/5b.

### Insight: matmul was already using the same pattern

While investigating other optimization axes, we discovered that the GGUF Q4 matmul code (`tq_gguf_quants.c:1561`) **already uses `vqtbl1q_s8`** for the codebook lookup. That's why fp32 and turbo_kv have identical matmul time (38.6 vs 38.9 ms in profile) — they both share the same NEON tbl matmul kernel.

This is why Round 10 worked: we'd been using NEON tbl in matmul since v0.5, but had built the attention path with scalar gather. Once we applied the same primitive to attention, the gap closed. Round 11 extended it to 3b/5b but hit the bit-packing constraint.

### What's NOT in v0.7.1

- 5b/3b at full parity. The remaining gap is in the unpack, not the lookup. Closing it needs either (a) a layout change (1-byte-per-index, sacrificing compression), (b) a SIMD bit-extraction trick, or (c) acceptance. We chose (c) for v0.7.1 with honest disclosure.
- `turbo_kv_4bo` / `turbo_kv_3bo` — research types, still on Round 9 path
- AVX2 / WASM SIMD ports of the NEON tbl pattern — separate session

### What changed in v0.7.1

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/core/tq_turbo_kv.c::tq_turbo_kv_3b_attention_ref` | NEON tbl + uint64 unpack |
| `src/core/tq_turbo_kv.c::tq_turbo_kv_5b_attention_ref` | NEON tbl + uint64 unpack |
| `README.md`, `README.ko.md` | Round 11 numbers |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | This entry |
| Memory `feedback_simd_unpack_constraint.md` | Documents the byte-alignment constraint for future work |

35/35 tests pass. PPL unchanged.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-08

### 🏆 Round 10 — `turbo_kv_4b` matches fp32 KV speed at 7.1× compression

After 10 rounds of Karpathy iteration (3 sessions), `turbo_kv_4b` now runs at **fp32 KV parity** on Llama 3.2 3B PPL eval. This is the breakthrough we've been chasing for 3 sessions:

| Type | Bytes/block | Compression | PPL | Δ vs FP32 | tok/s | vs FP32 speed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| FP32 KV | — | 1× | 13.56 | — | 17.9 | baseline |
| **`turbo_kv_4b`** ⭐ default | **72** | **7.1×** | **14.08** | **+3.8%** | **18.7** | **+4.5%** ⬆ |

### What it took: profile-driven Round 10

Rounds 1–9 had been optimizing local fusions in the inner loop without measuring where time was actually going. Profile data at long context (PPL eval, seq_len ~950) finally revealed the diff:

  - matmul: 38.6ms (fp32) vs 38.9ms (turbo_kv_4b) — same code path
  - attention: **15.7ms (fp32) vs 19.8ms (turbo_kv_4b)** — +4.1ms
  - The entire 8% gap was in attention, and the entire 4.1ms was in the inner dot-product loop

**Root cause**: turbo_kv inner loop was scalar (LUT load + mul + add per element) while fp32 was 4-way NEON SIMD. About 2× more instructions per element. The dequant lookup had become compute-bound, not memory-bound.

**Fix (Round 10)**: NEON 16-entry table lookup via `vqtbl1q_s8`.

  - Quantize the 16 Lloyd-Max-Gaussian centroids to int8 once at startup
  - Per-block: load 16 bytes of mse_indices = 32 nibbles
  - Split low/high nibbles via `vandq_u8` + `vshrq_n_u8`
  - `vqtbl1q_s8` for centroid gather (1 instruction, 16 lanes)
  - Convert int8 → int16 → fp32, multiply by per-block scale, FMA against query
  - 32 elements per iteration vs the previous 8 elements scalar

The int8 codebook discretization loses ~1% precision (well below the regression test threshold of cosine ≥ 0.99). PPL **improved** from 14.33 to 14.08 — the discretization happens to align favorably (or it's regression-to-mean, both directions are within noise).

### Cross-model verification

| Model | turbo_kv_4b speed gap (R9 → R10) | PPL Δ vs FP32 |
|---|---|---|
| SmolLM2 135M | -14.5% → -3.1% | +5.7% |
| Llama 3.2 1B | -16.3% → -1.3% | +5.4% |
| **Llama 3.2 3B** | **-8.4% → +4.5%** ⬆ | **+3.8%** |

All three models show massive speed improvement. Llama 3.2 3B (3-run average +0.8%, single run +4.5%) is now at parity or slightly faster than fp32 KV. Smaller models still have a small gap because relative attention overhead dominates.

### Honest framing change

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| "92% of fp32 speed at 7× compression" | **"PARITY with fp32 speed at 7× compression"** |

`turbo_kv_4b` is now **strictly Pareto-dominant** over `uniform_4b`: better PPL, better speed, comparable compression. And it's the **first KV quantization in the project that gives 7× memory savings without speed loss vs fp32**.

### What didn't change

- Block layout (still 72 bytes per block)
- Public API
- Quality regression tests pass (cosine ≥ 0.99 for 4b)
- 5b and 3b variants — still on the Round 9 scalar path (planned for v0.7.1)

### What changed

- `src/core/tq_turbo_kv.c::tq_turbo_kv_4b_attention_ref` — NEON tbl inner loop
- `README.md` / `README.ko.md` — headline tables show parity
- This CHANGELOG entry

35/35 tests pass. CI green.

## [0.6.5] — 2026-04-08

### 🚨 Re-baseline: all benchmarks now CPU-only (Metal is slower)

P3 (Metal compute graph for KV attention) investigation revealed that the existing Metal backend (`TQ_BUILD_METAL=ON`) is **net negative** on every model size we tested — 13–40% slower than CPU-only. The CMake default has always been `OFF`, so end users were getting the fast path. But our internal benchmarks (including all numbers in v0.6.0–v0.6.4 release notes) used `-DTQ_BUILD_METAL=ON` and were therefore 14–22% slower than what users actually get.

### Re-baselined numbers (Llama 3.2 3B Instruct, FP32 baseline = 13.56 PPL)

| Type | Bytes/block | tok/s (Metal OFF) | vs FP32 | PPL Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **FP32 KV** | — | **18.13** | baseline | — |
| **`turbo_kv_4b`** ⭐ | 72 | 16.60 | **−8.4%** | +5.7% |
| `turbo_kv_3b` | 56 | 15.77 | −13.0% | +13.3% |
| **`turbo_kv_5b`** 🏆 | 88 | 15.43 | −14.9% | +0.7% |
| `turbo_kv_4bo` | 96 | 15.20 | −16.2% | +2.5% |
| `uniform_4b` | 68 | 13.27 | −26.8% | +7.7% |

The relative gaps to FP32 are essentially unchanged (turbo_kv_4b is still ~8% slower) — both paths got the same ~20% speedup from removing Metal overhead. Pareto rankings unchanged.

### Cross-model Metal investigation

| Model | Metal OFF speedup vs Metal ON |
|---|---|
| SmolLM2 135M | neutral (within noise) |
| Llama 3.2 1B | +13–17% |
| Llama 3.2 3B | +14–22% |
| Gemma 4 26B | **+40%** |

Even on the largest model (Gemma 4 26B), Metal is net negative. Per-matmul dispatch overhead + waitUntilCompleted sync exceed the GPU compute benefit at batch-1 inference. Filed [issue #16](https://github.com/quantumaikr/quant.cpp/issues/16) with investigation plan.

### What changed in v0.6.5

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `README.md`, `README.ko.md` | Re-baselined headline tables and ASCII charts. New build note linking to issue #16. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | This entry. |
| Issue #16 | Filed: Metal backend is currently slower than CPU-only |

No source code changes — the CMake default was already `OFF`. The bug was in our internal benchmark methodology (we built with Metal ON without realizing it was slowing things down).

### Honest corrections so far in the v0.6.x series

This is now the **fourth** honest correction we've caught and fixed before it spread:

1. **v0.6.0**: "lossless 7× compression" → measured "+6.3% PPL on Llama 3.2 3B"
2. **v0.6.4**: "turbo_kv beats fp32 KV speed" → measured "−7% vs fp32 (NEON)"
3. **v0.6.5**: "benchmarks with Metal" → re-measured "benchmarks without Metal (which is the user default)"
4. **v0.6.5 (post-release)**: "Tim Dettmers gave us direct feedback" → "Tim's general comment to a thread we participate in happened to apply to us; we incorporated it voluntarily, not as a direct response". Earlier docs and the v0.6.4 commit message overstated the relationship; the substance of HIGGS attribution is unchanged but the framing has been corrected in README, README.ko, the arXiv draft, and `bench/results/turboquant_reproduction.md`.

Each correction was caught by the validation discipline documented in our `feedback_validation_first` memory. **Validation > marketing.**

## [0.6.4] — 2026-04-08

### Honest validation pass

This patch release exists to publish the **corrected** speed numbers
for v0.6.3 prominently. The v0.6.3 release shipped with the wrong
headline ('turbo_kv beats fp32 KV speed') because the fp32 attention
path was being compared in unoptimized scalar form. After NEON fix,
the honest gap is **−7% to −12%**, not **+5% to +10%**.

### What changed in this release

- **`tq_transformer.c`**: NEON-optimized the fp32 attention path
  (commit `4490c83`). FP32 attention went from 12.6 → 14.83 tok/s
  on Llama 3.2 3B (+18% standalone improvement).
- **README.md / README.ko.md**: corrected the headline tables and
  ASCII charts to reflect the honest fp32-NEON comparison
  (commit `33b6315`).
- **GitHub release notes for v0.6.3**: updated with a prominent
  Correction notice at the top.
- **`tq_transformer.c`**: Round 8 prefetch attempt reverted (no
  measurable benefit on Apple M1 Pro). Round 9 strided-attention
  not pursued (would require ABI change with no clear win).

### Final honest numbers (3 runs each, Llama 3.2 3B PPL eval)

| Type | Avg tok/s | vs FP32 | PPL Δ | Compression |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **FP32 KV** (NEON) | **14.63** | baseline | — | 1× |
| **`turbo_kv_4b`** ⭐ default | 13.57 | **−7.2%** | +5.7% | **7.1×** |
| **`turbo_kv_3b`** | 13.13 | −10.2% | +13.3% | 9.1× |
| **`turbo_kv_5b`** 🏆 quality | 12.90 | −11.8% | +0.7% | 5.8× |

### What we learned

1. **Validation is the most valuable step.** It found the wrong claim
   before it spread to users.
2. **The Round 5 win is real.** turbo_kv_4b went from 6.9 → 13.6 tok/s
   (+97%). Just the comparison baseline was wrong.
3. **Local optimum reached.** Rounds 8 and 9 (prefetch, strided gather)
   gave no measurable improvement. Further wins would need structural
   changes (e.g., a different KV cache memory layout, or true parallel
   attention dispatch).
4. **Pareto improvement is still real.** turbo_kv_4b dominates
   `uniform_4b` on quality (14.33 vs 14.60 PPL) AND speed (13.57 vs
   11.7 tok/s) AND compression (7.1× vs 7.5× — close enough).

## [0.6.3] — 2026-04-08

### Karpathy round 5+6: closes turbo_kv speed gap from −45% to −8%

> **Correction**: this entry originally claimed 'turbo_kv beats fp32 KV speed'. That was an artifact of the fp32 attention path being unoptimized scalar. After NEON-optimizing fp32 too (commit `4490c83`), the honest gap is `−7%` to `−12%`, not `+5%` to `+10%`. We caught the wrong claim during validation and corrected it before publishing widely.

After 9 rounds of Karpathy iteration, all three production turbo_kv types now run within 8–12% of fp32 KV speed while compressing 5.8–9.1×:

| Type | Bytes/block | tok/s | vs FP32 | PPL | Δ vs FP32 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| FP32 KV (NEON) | — | **14.83** | baseline | 13.56 | — |
| **`turbo_kv_4b`** ⭐ | 72 | 13.67 | **−7.8%** | 14.33 | +5.7% |
| **`turbo_kv_3b`** | 56 | 13.4 | −9.6% | 15.36 | +13.3% |
| **`turbo_kv_5b`** 🏆 | 88 | 13.13 | −11.5% | 13.65 | +0.7% |

### What changed (Round 5: the real bottleneck)

The biggest win came from `tq_transformer.c`. The `use_quant_kv` path
was calling `traits->dequantize` once per cached key per token, which
internally ran `tq_rht_inverse()` (O(d log d)) per call — dominating
the total cost at long context.

Round 5 changes the inner loop to use the type's optimized
`traits->attention` kernel, which:
1. Pre-rotates the query ONCE per layer
2. Does fused dequant + dot product per block in rotated space
3. Skips per-position inverse RHT entirely

Old slow path is preserved as a fallback for the complex cases:
QK-norm-on-stored-keys, k_highres_window, sliding-window attention.

### Karpathy loop (this release)

| Round | What changed | Llama 3.2 3B turbo_kv_4b tok/s |
|---:|---|---:|
| 0 | Baseline (per-position dequant + inline dot) | 6.9 |
| 1 | Single-pass dequant with hoisted LUT | 7.0 |
| 2 | Fused dequant+dot via NEON lane construction | regression — revert |
| 3 | Apply Round 1 to 3b/5b dequants | 7.0 |
| 4 | Pure scalar fused with 4 accumulators | 7.0 |
| 5 | **transformer uses traits->attention (no per-pos RHT inverse)** | **13.5** ✅ |
| 6 | Hoist LUT in 4bo/3bo dequants | 13.9 |

PPL changed slightly across the FP reordering (0.3–0.5% increase per
type, all within the regression test cosine ≥ 0.99/0.999 thresholds).
35/35 tests pass.

### Other changes

- New tracking issue #15 follow-up notes for per-head rotation seeds and
  Llama 3.1 8B + LongBench-E reproduction (still open)

## [0.6.2] — 2026-04-08

### Highlights

- **🆕 `turbo_kv_4bo` / `turbo_kv_3bo`** — Per-block outlier handling research types. Each block stores the K=8 channels with the largest |rotated[i]| as exact FP16 values that overwrite the codebook reconstruction at dequant time. This is a simpler local form of the per-channel outlier handling described in the Google TurboQuant paper.
- **Karpathy-loop validation**: per-channel outliers cut the PPL gap **by more than half** on Llama 3.2 3B (4b: +5.3% → 4bo: +2.2%). Effect is model-dependent — see notes below.
- **Issue #15 progress**: closes the per-channel outlier handling exploration item. 5b remains the recommended quality option; 4bo/3bo ship as experimental.

### KV quantization quality (Llama 3.2 3B, FP32 = 13.56 PPL)

| Type | Bytes/block | Compression | PPL | Δ vs FP32 | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `turbo_kv_3b` | 56 | 9.1× | 15.39 | +13.5% | aggressive |
| `turbo_kv_4b` ⭐ default | 72 | 7.1× | 14.28 | +5.3% | production |
| **`turbo_kv_3bo`** 🧪 | 80 | 6.4× | 14.03 | +3.5% | research |
| **`turbo_kv_5b`** 🏆 quality | 88 | 5.8× | **13.60** | **+0.34%** | production |
| **`turbo_kv_4bo`** 🧪 | 96 | 5.3× | 13.86 | +2.2% | research |

### Notes on the outlier types

Per-channel outlier handling is **data-dependent**:
- On Llama 3.2 3B (head_dim=128, heavier tails), `3bo` Pareto-improves over `4b`
- On SmolLM2 135M (smaller dimensions), `3bo` regresses past `4b` because the 3-bit base is too coarse
- `4bo` is dominated by `5b` on both models — slightly bigger and slightly worse

Until per-model auto-selection is implemented, the Pareto-optimal recommendations remain `turbo_kv_4b` (default) and `turbo_kv_5b` (quality). The outlier types are exposed for researchers and benchmarking.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-04-08

### Highlights

- **🆕 `turbo_kv_5b` — near-lossless KV** at +0.34% PPL on Llama 3.2 3B. Uses a 32-level Lloyd-Max-Gaussian codebook (Max 1960 Table I) on RHT-rotated values. 88-byte block (vs 72 for 4b). The new quality-maximizing option for users who can spare 22% more KV memory than 4b.
- **Regression tests** — three deterministic synthetic-data tests pin the attention cosine quality of `turbo_kv_4b` (≥0.99) and `turbo_kv_5b` (≥0.999), and assert 5b ≥ 4b on the same data. Future Karpathy-loop iterations cannot regress past these thresholds without failing CI.

### KV quantization quality (Llama 3.2 3B, FP32 = 13.56 PPL)

| Type | Bytes/block | Compression | PPL | Δ vs FP32 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `turbo_kv_3b` | 56 | 9.1× | 15.39 | +13.5% |
| `turbo_kv_4b` ⭐ default | 72 | 7.1× | 14.28 | +5.3% |
| **`turbo_kv_5b`** 🏆 | 88 | 5.8× | **13.60** | **+0.34%** |

### Tests

- `TurboKVRegression.KV_4B_AttentionCosine` — pins ≥ 0.99
- `TurboKVRegression.KV_5B_AttentionCosine` — pins ≥ 0.999
- `TurboKVRegression.KV_5B_BeatsKV_4B` — invariant: more bits ⇒ ≥ accuracy

35/35 tests pass on macOS / Linux / Windows.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-08

### Highlights

- **🏆 turbo_kv_4b is the new champion** — Beats both `uniform_4b` and llama.cpp `q4_0` KV at the same 4-bit budget on Llama 3.2 3B (PPL 14.28 vs 14.41 vs ~14.99). Reached after 6 rounds of Karpathy-loop iteration starting from a literal port of [Google TurboQuant (ICLR 2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19874).
- **CLI default switched** — `quant model.gguf` now uses `turbo_kv_4b` automatically. `uniform_4b` remains available via `-k uniform_4b`.
- **Honest TurboQuant reproduction story** — full ablation history, public issue #14, no overstated claims. The shipped `turbo_kv_*` is structurally simpler than the paper (single-stage RHT + Lloyd-Max codebook + ‖x‖) but empirically beats the literal two-stage port on our benchmark.
- **@quantcpp/wasm npm package** — `npm install @quantcpp/wasm` to drop a 192KB GGUF inference engine into any web project.
- **Windows CI green** — pthread_cond_wait SRWLOCK deadlock fixed, MSVC `__builtin_*` shims, /tmp paths in tests, M_PI in test_neon_scalar. 35/35 tests pass on macOS / Linux / Windows.
- **Public PR & issue triage** — PR #12 (5 critical bug fixes from MChorfa) cherry-picked into main; PR #13 reformatting noise rejected, examples README + CMake separation salvaged.

### KV quantization

The `turbo_kv_3b` / `turbo_kv_4b` block layouts changed in this release. The `qjl_signs` field is gone — Karpathy-loop ablation showed it contributed byte-identical zero to attention scores. The freed 16 bytes per block are now used for a 2× larger Lloyd-Max codebook. Same total block size, finer reconstruction, single-stage estimator.

| KV type | Bits/elem | Llama 3.2 3B PPL | Δ vs FP32 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| FP32 baseline | 32 | 13.56 | — |
| **`turbo_kv_4b`** ⭐ | 4 | **14.28** | **+5.3%** |
| `uniform_4b` | 4 | 14.41 | +6.3% |
| `turbo_kv_3b` | 3 | 15.39 | +13.5% |
| llama.cpp q4_0 KV (rough) | 4 | ~14.99 | +10.6% |

### Strategy & positioning

- New `docs/positioning.md` — quant.cpp = the single-header C reference engine for the embedded niche (iOS, Android, WASM, MSVC, microcontrollers, game engines)
- README repositioned to honest "production = turbo_kv_4b, research = building blocks" framing with full PPL methodology
- Citations to Google TurboQuant, PolarQuant, QJL papers added throughout

### Tooling & ecosystem

- `wasm/package.json` + ESM `index.mjs` + `index.d.ts` for npm publishing
- `examples/README.md` (cherry-picked from PR #13) — comprehensive embedding examples doc
- CMake `TQ_BUILD_EXAMPLES` option, single-header examples link only against libm + threads
- Windows CI test timeouts bumped to 600s for slow non-vectorized builds

### Bug fixes (cherry-picked from PR #12)

- `tq_qjl.c`: NaN guard requires `dim > 0`
- `tq_uniform.c`: heap-allocate Q8 query buffer (was 512B stack array)
- `tq_transformer.c`: NULL-check key/value cache calloc results
- `tq_ops.c`: Windows pthread_cond_wait must use `SleepConditionVariableSRW` not `CS` (caused test_ops deadlock on first Windows green run)

### Tracked for next release (issue #14 follow-ups)

- Per-channel outlier handling (Google paper's 32-channel split)
- Paper-faithful Llama 3.1 8B + LongBench-E reproduction
- 5-bit codebook variant for higher quality at ~5 bpc

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-29

### Highlights

- **Self-contained inference engine** — loads Qwen3.5-0.8B, generates text at 14 tok/s on CPU
- **17x faster than PyTorch CPU**, 1.4x faster than PyTorch on Apple GPU
- **Q8 weight quantization** — 4x memory reduction (2.1 GB → 533 MB), `-q` flag
- **Streaming BF16** — embed/lm_head kept as mmap'd BF16, saves ~1 GB
- **Multi-threaded matmul** — 4-thread pthread, 1.56x speedup

- **HuggingFace BPE tokenizer** — 248K vocab, encode/decode
- **KV cache quantized in inference** — Q4 keys, integer Q4×Q8 attention

### v0.8 Inference Engine

- **Integer-domain attention**: 2.9-4.8x faster than FP32 on Apple Silicon (ARM NEON `vdotq_s32`)
- **Real model validated**: Qwen3.5-0.8B KV cache, cosine 0.994 (A+)
- **8 quantization types** including mixed precision outlier and RHT pre-rotation
- **K/V asymmetric**: independent key/value bit allocation (K4V2 = 9.8x compression)
- **Community validated**: r/LocalLLaMA findings integrated

### Integer-Domain Attention (v0.7)

The single biggest performance breakthrough: instead of dequantizing Q4 keys to FP32,
quantize the query to Q8 and compute integer dot products directly.

```
Before (v0.6): Q4 key → dequantize → FP32 dot = 0.49x vs FP32 (SLOWER)
After  (v0.7): Q4 key × Q8 query → integer dot = 2.9-4.8x vs FP32 (FASTER)
```

Fair NEON-vs-NEON benchmark (Apple M-series, median of 7 runs):
- dim=128, seq=2048: FP32 22.8μs → Int Q4×Q8 7.8μs (2.9x)
- dim=256, seq=2048: FP32 57.7μs → Int Q4×Q8 12.5μs (4.6x)
- Larger head_dim benefits more (Q4 data fits in L1 cache)

### Core Library
- 7 quantization types: PolarQuant (3/4b), QJL (1b), quant.cpp (3/4b), Uniform (2/4b)
- Direct attention kernels: QJL Hamming distance, PolarQuant cos/sin LUT (no dequantization needed)
- Self-contained block formats with ONNX-compliant LSB-first bit packing
- O(1) type traits dispatch table (llama.cpp pattern)
- Thread-safe API with pthread mutex (TSan verified)
- Cross-platform math constants (TQ_PI/TQ_PI_2, no M_PI dependency)

### Cache Management
- Paged KV cache with block-table mapping (vLLM pattern)
- Progressive compression: 3-tier automatic degradation by age, O(1) append
- Copy-on-Write for beam search (ref_count based)
- Value cache quantization and retrieval

### Backends
- CPU Generic (reference C11, zero external dependencies)
- ARM NEON optimized (5.74x speedup over generic)
- x86 AVX2 stubs ready for implementation
- CUDA kernels: 7 files (polar, qjl, turbo, fused_cache, value, common, dispatch)
- Metal compute shaders: 7 files (polar, qjl, turbo, fused_cache, value, common, dispatch)

### Validation
- **A/B test**: uniform_4b achieves cosine 0.995 vs FP16 — A+ grade, virtually lossless
- **Real model validation**: cosine 0.991 on Qwen3.5-0.5B KV cache patterns (4 layers, 14 heads)
- Per-layer analysis: quality consistent across depth (cosine >0.98 for uniform_4b)
- Roundtrip MSE: 0.0014 (synthetic), 0.0025 (real model data)

### Performance (Apple M-series ARM)
- Quantize throughput: 1.4M elements/ms
- Attention throughput: 137K queries/sec
- Compression ratio: 7.53x (uniform_4b)
- SIMD speedup: 4.0x (NEON vs generic)

### Testing
- 13 C++ test suites (Google Test): polar, qjl, turbo, uniform, value, paged_cache, progressive, simd_neon, simd_avx2, threading, edge_cases, attention_all_types, llamacpp_integration
- 22 Python tests (unittest): bindings, roundtrip, attention, types
- Total: **35 tests, 100% pass rate**
- Sanitizers: ASan + UBSan + TSan clean

### Integration
- **llama.cpp**: GGML type registration (7 types, base offset 256), CLI parser with 21 aliases, from_float/to_float/vec_dot wrappers, 10 integration tests
- **Python**: ctypes bindings with NumPy support, pip installable (`pip install -e .`), quant.cpp class with quantize_keys/dequantize_keys/attention methods
- **vLLM**: integration scaffold with README guide
- **Examples**: minimal.c (10 lines), standalone.c, ab_test.c, demo_real_model.c, benchmark_types.cpp, python_quickstart.py, llamacpp_integration.cpp

### Production Readiness (v0.4)
