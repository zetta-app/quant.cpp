## [0.6.5] — 2026-04-08

### 🚨 Re-baseline: all benchmarks now CPU-only (Metal is slower)

P3 (Metal compute graph for KV attention) investigation revealed that the existing Metal backend (`TQ_BUILD_METAL=ON`) is **net negative** on every model size we tested — 13–40% slower than CPU-only. The CMake default has always been `OFF`, so end users were getting the fast path. But our internal benchmarks (including all numbers in v0.6.0–v0.6.4 release notes) used `-DTQ_BUILD_METAL=ON` and were therefore 14–22% slower than what users actually get.

### Re-baselined numbers (Llama 3.2 3B Instruct, FP32 baseline = 13.56 PPL)

| Type | Bytes/block | tok/s (Metal OFF) | vs FP32 | PPL Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **FP32 KV** | — | **18.13** | baseline | — |
| **`turbo_kv_4b`** ⭐ | 72 | 16.60 | **−8.4%** | +5.7% |
| `turbo_kv_3b` | 56 | 15.77 | −13.0% | +13.3% |
| **`turbo_kv_5b`** 🏆 | 88 | 15.43 | −14.9% | +0.7% |
| `turbo_kv_4bo` | 96 | 15.20 | −16.2% | +2.5% |
| `uniform_4b` | 68 | 13.27 | −26.8% | +7.7% |

The relative gaps to FP32 are essentially unchanged (turbo_kv_4b is still ~8% slower) — both paths got the same ~20% speedup from removing Metal overhead. Pareto rankings unchanged.

### Cross-model Metal investigation

| Model | Metal OFF speedup vs Metal ON |
|---|---|
| SmolLM2 135M | neutral (within noise) |
| Llama 3.2 1B | +13–17% |
| Llama 3.2 3B | +14–22% |
| Gemma 4 26B | **+40%** |

Even on the largest model (Gemma 4 26B), Metal is net negative. Per-matmul dispatch overhead + waitUntilCompleted sync exceed the GPU compute benefit at batch-1 inference. Filed [issue #16](https://github.com/quantumaikr/quant.cpp/issues/16) with investigation plan.

### What changed in v0.6.5

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `README.md`, `README.ko.md` | Re-baselined headline tables and ASCII charts. New build note linking to issue #16. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | This entry. |
| Issue #16 | Filed: Metal backend is currently slower than CPU-only |

No source code changes — the CMake default was already `OFF`. The bug was in our internal benchmark methodology (we built with Metal ON without realizing it was slowing things down).

### Honest corrections so far in the v0.6.x series

This is now the **third** honest correction we've caught and fixed before it spread:

1. **v0.6.0**: "lossless 7× compression" → measured "+6.3% PPL on Llama 3.2 3B"
2. **v0.6.4**: "turbo_kv beats fp32 KV speed" → measured "−7% vs fp32 (NEON)"
3. **v0.6.5**: "benchmarks with Metal" → re-measured "benchmarks without Metal (which is the user default)"

Each correction was caught by the validation discipline documented in our `feedback_validation_first` memory. **Validation > marketing.**

## [0.6.4] — 2026-04-08

### Honest validation pass

This patch release exists to publish the **corrected** speed numbers
for v0.6.3 prominently. The v0.6.3 release shipped with the wrong
headline ('turbo_kv beats fp32 KV speed') because the fp32 attention
path was being compared in unoptimized scalar form. After NEON fix,
the honest gap is **−7% to −12%**, not **+5% to +10%**.

### What changed in this release

- **`tq_transformer.c`**: NEON-optimized the fp32 attention path
  (commit `4490c83`). FP32 attention went from 12.6 → 14.83 tok/s
  on Llama 3.2 3B (+18% standalone improvement).
- **README.md / README.ko.md**: corrected the headline tables and
  ASCII charts to reflect the honest fp32-NEON comparison
  (commit `33b6315`).
- **GitHub release notes for v0.6.3**: updated with a prominent
  Correction notice at the top.
- **`tq_transformer.c`**: Round 8 prefetch attempt reverted (no
  measurable benefit on Apple M1 Pro). Round 9 strided-attention
  not pursued (would require ABI change with no clear win).

### Final honest numbers (3 runs each, Llama 3.2 3B PPL eval)

| Type | Avg tok/s | vs FP32 | PPL Δ | Compression |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **FP32 KV** (NEON) | **14.63** | baseline | — | 1× |
| **`turbo_kv_4b`** ⭐ default | 13.57 | **−7.2%** | +5.7% | **7.1×** |
| **`turbo_kv_3b`** | 13.13 | −10.2% | +13.3% | 9.1× |
| **`turbo_kv_5b`** 🏆 quality | 12.90 | −11.8% | +0.7% | 5.8× |

### What we learned

1. **Validation is the most valuable step.** It found the wrong claim
   before it spread to users.
2. **The Round 5 win is real.** turbo_kv_4b went from 6.9 → 13.6 tok/s
   (+97%). Just the comparison baseline was wrong.
3. **Local optimum reached.** Rounds 8 and 9 (prefetch, strided gather)
   gave no measurable improvement. Further wins would need structural
   changes (e.g., a different KV cache memory layout, or true parallel
   attention dispatch).
4. **Pareto improvement is still real.** turbo_kv_4b dominates
   `uniform_4b` on quality (14.33 vs 14.60 PPL) AND speed (13.57 vs
   11.7 tok/s) AND compression (7.1× vs 7.5× — close enough).

## [0.6.3] — 2026-04-08

### Karpathy round 5+6: closes turbo_kv speed gap from −45% to −8%

> **Correction**: this entry originally claimed 'turbo_kv beats fp32 KV speed'. That was an artifact of the fp32 attention path being unoptimized scalar. After NEON-optimizing fp32 too (commit `4490c83`), the honest gap is `−7%` to `−12%`, not `+5%` to `+10%`. We caught the wrong claim during validation and corrected it before publishing widely.

After 9 rounds of Karpathy iteration, all three production turbo_kv types now run within 8–12% of fp32 KV speed while compressing 5.8–9.1×:

| Type | Bytes/block | tok/s | vs FP32 | PPL | Δ vs FP32 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| FP32 KV (NEON) | — | **14.83** | baseline | 13.56 | — |
| **`turbo_kv_4b`** ⭐ | 72 | 13.67 | **−7.8%** | 14.33 | +5.7% |
| **`turbo_kv_3b`** | 56 | 13.4 | −9.6% | 15.36 | +13.3% |
| **`turbo_kv_5b`** 🏆 | 88 | 13.13 | −11.5% | 13.65 | +0.7% |

### What changed (Round 5: the real bottleneck)

The biggest win came from `tq_transformer.c`. The `use_quant_kv` path
was calling `traits->dequantize` once per cached key per token, which
internally ran `tq_rht_inverse()` (O(d log d)) per call — dominating
the total cost at long context.

Round 5 changes the inner loop to use the type's optimized
`traits->attention` kernel, which:
1. Pre-rotates the query ONCE per layer
2. Does fused dequant + dot product per block in rotated space
3. Skips per-position inverse RHT entirely

Old slow path is preserved as a fallback for the complex cases:
QK-norm-on-stored-keys, k_highres_window, sliding-window attention.

### Karpathy loop (this release)

| Round | What changed | Llama 3.2 3B turbo_kv_4b tok/s |
|---:|---|---:|
| 0 | Baseline (per-position dequant + inline dot) | 6.9 |
| 1 | Single-pass dequant with hoisted LUT | 7.0 |
| 2 | Fused dequant+dot via NEON lane construction | regression — revert |
| 3 | Apply Round 1 to 3b/5b dequants | 7.0 |
| 4 | Pure scalar fused with 4 accumulators | 7.0 |
| 5 | **transformer uses traits->attention (no per-pos RHT inverse)** | **13.5** ✅ |
| 6 | Hoist LUT in 4bo/3bo dequants | 13.9 |

PPL changed slightly across the FP reordering (0.3–0.5% increase per
type, all within the regression test cosine ≥ 0.99/0.999 thresholds).
35/35 tests pass.

### Other changes

- New tracking issue #15 follow-up notes for per-head rotation seeds and
  Llama 3.1 8B + LongBench-E reproduction (still open)

## [0.6.2] — 2026-04-08

### Highlights

- **🆕 `turbo_kv_4bo` / `turbo_kv_3bo`** — Per-block outlier handling research types. Each block stores the K=8 channels with the largest |rotated[i]| as exact FP16 values that overwrite the codebook reconstruction at dequant time. This is a simpler local form of the per-channel outlier handling described in the Google TurboQuant paper.
- **Karpathy-loop validation**: per-channel outliers cut the PPL gap **by more than half** on Llama 3.2 3B (4b: +5.3% → 4bo: +2.2%). Effect is model-dependent — see notes below.
- **Issue #15 progress**: closes the per-channel outlier handling exploration item. 5b remains the recommended quality option; 4bo/3bo ship as experimental.

### KV quantization quality (Llama 3.2 3B, FP32 = 13.56 PPL)

| Type | Bytes/block | Compression | PPL | Δ vs FP32 | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `turbo_kv_3b` | 56 | 9.1× | 15.39 | +13.5% | aggressive |
| `turbo_kv_4b` ⭐ default | 72 | 7.1× | 14.28 | +5.3% | production |
| **`turbo_kv_3bo`** 🧪 | 80 | 6.4× | 14.03 | +3.5% | research |
| **`turbo_kv_5b`** 🏆 quality | 88 | 5.8× | **13.60** | **+0.34%** | production |
| **`turbo_kv_4bo`** 🧪 | 96 | 5.3× | 13.86 | +2.2% | research |

### Notes on the outlier types

Per-channel outlier handling is **data-dependent**:
- On Llama 3.2 3B (head_dim=128, heavier tails), `3bo` Pareto-improves over `4b`
- On SmolLM2 135M (smaller dimensions), `3bo` regresses past `4b` because the 3-bit base is too coarse
- `4bo` is dominated by `5b` on both models — slightly bigger and slightly worse

Until per-model auto-selection is implemented, the Pareto-optimal recommendations remain `turbo_kv_4b` (default) and `turbo_kv_5b` (quality). The outlier types are exposed for researchers and benchmarking.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-04-08

### Highlights

- **🆕 `turbo_kv_5b` — near-lossless KV** at +0.34% PPL on Llama 3.2 3B. Uses a 32-level Lloyd-Max-Gaussian codebook (Max 1960 Table I) on RHT-rotated values. 88-byte block (vs 72 for 4b). The new quality-maximizing option for users who can spare 22% more KV memory than 4b.
- **Regression tests** — three deterministic synthetic-data tests pin the attention cosine quality of `turbo_kv_4b` (≥0.99) and `turbo_kv_5b` (≥0.999), and assert 5b ≥ 4b on the same data. Future Karpathy-loop iterations cannot regress past these thresholds without failing CI.

### KV quantization quality (Llama 3.2 3B, FP32 = 13.56 PPL)

| Type | Bytes/block | Compression | PPL | Δ vs FP32 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `turbo_kv_3b` | 56 | 9.1× | 15.39 | +13.5% |
| `turbo_kv_4b` ⭐ default | 72 | 7.1× | 14.28 | +5.3% |
| **`turbo_kv_5b`** 🏆 | 88 | 5.8× | **13.60** | **+0.34%** |

### Tests

- `TurboKVRegression.KV_4B_AttentionCosine` — pins ≥ 0.99
- `TurboKVRegression.KV_5B_AttentionCosine` — pins ≥ 0.999
- `TurboKVRegression.KV_5B_BeatsKV_4B` — invariant: more bits ⇒ ≥ accuracy

35/35 tests pass on macOS / Linux / Windows.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-08

### Highlights

- **🏆 turbo_kv_4b is the new champion** — Beats both `uniform_4b` and llama.cpp `q4_0` KV at the same 4-bit budget on Llama 3.2 3B (PPL 14.28 vs 14.41 vs ~14.99). Reached after 6 rounds of Karpathy-loop iteration starting from a literal port of [Google TurboQuant (ICLR 2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19874).
- **CLI default switched** — `quant model.gguf` now uses `turbo_kv_4b` automatically. `uniform_4b` remains available via `-k uniform_4b`.
- **Honest TurboQuant reproduction story** — full ablation history, public issue #14, no overstated claims. The shipped `turbo_kv_*` is structurally simpler than the paper (single-stage RHT + Lloyd-Max codebook + ‖x‖) but empirically beats the literal two-stage port on our benchmark.
- **@quantcpp/wasm npm package** — `npm install @quantcpp/wasm` to drop a 192KB GGUF inference engine into any web project.
- **Windows CI green** — pthread_cond_wait SRWLOCK deadlock fixed, MSVC `__builtin_*` shims, /tmp paths in tests, M_PI in test_neon_scalar. 35/35 tests pass on macOS / Linux / Windows.
- **Public PR & issue triage** — PR #12 (5 critical bug fixes from MChorfa) cherry-picked into main; PR #13 reformatting noise rejected, examples README + CMake separation salvaged.

### KV quantization

The `turbo_kv_3b` / `turbo_kv_4b` block layouts changed in this release. The `qjl_signs` field is gone — Karpathy-loop ablation showed it contributed byte-identical zero to attention scores. The freed 16 bytes per block are now used for a 2× larger Lloyd-Max codebook. Same total block size, finer reconstruction, single-stage estimator.

| KV type | Bits/elem | Llama 3.2 3B PPL | Δ vs FP32 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| FP32 baseline | 32 | 13.56 | — |
| **`turbo_kv_4b`** ⭐ | 4 | **14.28** | **+5.3%** |
| `uniform_4b` | 4 | 14.41 | +6.3% |
| `turbo_kv_3b` | 3 | 15.39 | +13.5% |
| llama.cpp q4_0 KV (rough) | 4 | ~14.99 | +10.6% |

### Strategy & positioning

- New `docs/positioning.md` — quant.cpp = the single-header C reference engine for the embedded niche (iOS, Android, WASM, MSVC, microcontrollers, game engines)
- README repositioned to honest "production = turbo_kv_4b, research = building blocks" framing with full PPL methodology
- Citations to Google TurboQuant, PolarQuant, QJL papers added throughout

### Tooling & ecosystem

- `wasm/package.json` + ESM `index.mjs` + `index.d.ts` for npm publishing
- `examples/README.md` (cherry-picked from PR #13) — comprehensive embedding examples doc
- CMake `TQ_BUILD_EXAMPLES` option, single-header examples link only against libm + threads
- Windows CI test timeouts bumped to 600s for slow non-vectorized builds

### Bug fixes (cherry-picked from PR #12)

- `tq_qjl.c`: NaN guard requires `dim > 0`
- `tq_uniform.c`: heap-allocate Q8 query buffer (was 512B stack array)
- `tq_transformer.c`: NULL-check key/value cache calloc results
- `tq_ops.c`: Windows pthread_cond_wait must use `SleepConditionVariableSRW` not `CS` (caused test_ops deadlock on first Windows green run)

### Tracked for next release (issue #14 follow-ups)

- Per-channel outlier handling (Google paper's 32-channel split)
- Paper-faithful Llama 3.1 8B + LongBench-E reproduction
- 5-bit codebook variant for higher quality at ~5 bpc

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-29

### Highlights

- **Self-contained inference engine** — loads Qwen3.5-0.8B, generates text at 14 tok/s on CPU
- **17x faster than PyTorch CPU**, 1.4x faster than PyTorch on Apple GPU
- **Q8 weight quantization** — 4x memory reduction (2.1 GB → 533 MB), `-q` flag
- **Streaming BF16** — embed/lm_head kept as mmap'd BF16, saves ~1 GB
- **Multi-threaded matmul** — 4-thread pthread, 1.56x speedup
- **DeltaNet + Self-Attention** — full Qwen3.5 hybrid architecture in C
- **HuggingFace BPE tokenizer** — 248K vocab, encode/decode
- **KV cache quantized in inference** — Q4 keys, integer Q4×Q8 attention

### v0.8 Inference Engine

- **Integer-domain attention**: 2.9-4.8x faster than FP32 on Apple Silicon (ARM NEON `vdotq_s32`)
- **Real model validated**: Qwen3.5-0.8B KV cache, cosine 0.994 (A+)
- **8 quantization types** including mixed precision outlier and RHT pre-rotation
- **K/V asymmetric**: independent key/value bit allocation (K4V2 = 9.8x compression)
- **Community validated**: r/LocalLLaMA findings integrated

### Integer-Domain Attention (v0.7)

The single biggest performance breakthrough: instead of dequantizing Q4 keys to FP32,
quantize the query to Q8 and compute integer dot products directly.

```
Before (v0.6): Q4 key → dequantize → FP32 dot = 0.49x vs FP32 (SLOWER)
After  (v0.7): Q4 key × Q8 query → integer dot = 2.9-4.8x vs FP32 (FASTER)
```

Fair NEON-vs-NEON benchmark (Apple M-series, median of 7 runs):
- dim=128, seq=2048: FP32 22.8μs → Int Q4×Q8 7.8μs (2.9x)
- dim=256, seq=2048: FP32 57.7μs → Int Q4×Q8 12.5μs (4.6x)
- Larger head_dim benefits more (Q4 data fits in L1 cache)

### Core Library
- 7 quantization types: PolarQuant (3/4b), QJL (1b), quant.cpp (3/4b), Uniform (2/4b)
- Direct attention kernels: QJL Hamming distance, PolarQuant cos/sin LUT (no dequantization needed)
- Self-contained block formats with ONNX-compliant LSB-first bit packing
- O(1) type traits dispatch table (llama.cpp pattern)
- Thread-safe API with pthread mutex (TSan verified)
- Cross-platform math constants (TQ_PI/TQ_PI_2, no M_PI dependency)

### Cache Management
- Paged KV cache with block-table mapping (vLLM pattern)
- Progressive compression: 3-tier automatic degradation by age, O(1) append
- Copy-on-Write for beam search (ref_count based)
- Value cache quantization and retrieval

### Backends
- CPU Generic (reference C11, zero external dependencies)
- ARM NEON optimized (5.74x speedup over generic)
- x86 AVX2 stubs ready for implementation
- CUDA kernels: 7 files (polar, qjl, turbo, fused_cache, value, common, dispatch)
- Metal compute shaders: 7 files (polar, qjl, turbo, fused_cache, value, common, dispatch)

### Validation
- **A/B test**: uniform_4b achieves cosine 0.995 vs FP16 — A+ grade, virtually lossless
- **Real model validation**: cosine 0.991 on Qwen3.5-0.5B KV cache patterns (4 layers, 14 heads)
- Per-layer analysis: quality consistent across depth (cosine >0.98 for uniform_4b)
- Roundtrip MSE: 0.0014 (synthetic), 0.0025 (real model data)

### Performance (Apple M-series ARM)
- Quantize throughput: 1.4M elements/ms
- Attention throughput: 137K queries/sec
- Compression ratio: 7.53x (uniform_4b)
- SIMD speedup: 4.0x (NEON vs generic)

### Testing
- 13 C++ test suites (Google Test): polar, qjl, turbo, uniform, value, paged_cache, progressive, simd_neon, simd_avx2, threading, edge_cases, attention_all_types, llamacpp_integration
- 22 Python tests (unittest): bindings, roundtrip, attention, types
- Total: **35 tests, 100% pass rate**
- Sanitizers: ASan + UBSan + TSan clean

### Integration
- **llama.cpp**: GGML type registration (7 types, base offset 256), CLI parser with 21 aliases, from_float/to_float/vec_dot wrappers, 10 integration tests
- **Python**: ctypes bindings with NumPy support, pip installable (`pip install -e .`), quant.cpp class with quantize_keys/dequantize_keys/attention methods
- **vLLM**: integration scaffold with README guide
- **Examples**: minimal.c (10 lines), standalone.c, ab_test.c, demo_real_model.c, benchmark_types.cpp, python_quickstart.py, llamacpp_integration.cpp

### Production Readiness (v0.4)
